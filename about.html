        <div>
            <h6 class="detail">The story of modern textiles in the Pakistan is the story of JR Fabrications. The group began trading in textiles in the early 1900s. The group entered in the field of manufacturing with the establishment of today's iconic name of JR Fabircations.

                With an installed capacity of more than 130,000 spindles, 300 state-of-the-art weaving machines and most modern yarn dyeing, processing & stitching units, JR Fabrications is a composite unit – making everything from cotton yarn to finished products.

            <h3 class="us">Excellence. Innovation. Value. Style. </h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h6 class="detail">With over 2 years of experience, JR Fabircations continues its legacy of providing superior fabric, value for money and trendsetting apparel to its consumers. It all began in 2018 when the textile industry had not even flourished to its complete potential, that JR Fabircations initiated ready-made winter wear, particularly knits for men, women and children. From then on, JR Fabircations became a prestigious brand and won respect as the master of detail in the realm of ready-made garments manufacturing.

                With over 80+ outlets across Pakistan, JR Fabircations stands as an enormous textile giant today. However, looking at the market potential amongst clothing brands for women, JR Fabircations furthermore ventured into creating its exclusive women’s clothing line  in 2012 which has now become a one-stop clothing solution for the women of Pakistan . Thus we became to be known as JR Fabircations.
                
                The umbrella brand is now clearly divided into two: JR Fabircations – Men’s Formal Clothing, Knits, and Ethnic Wear; and Women's Collections – Women’s Prêt, Unstitched, and Accessories.</h6>
